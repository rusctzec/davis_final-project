## Gameplay

Players browse the Gallery page of the application, viewing existing games and drawings, and can join at will, adding to drawings concurrently alongside other players.
The utility buttons on the canvas screen allow the player to switch tools, adding to, erasing, and panning the canvas, as well as switching modes and taking control of a character that can interact with and traverse their drawings directly in the style of a platformer game.
